                            designed and built

                            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to
                            visualize work,
                            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span

                                When you log in to <span class="joinSpanBlue">Join</span>, you'll find a default
                                board. This
                                board represents your project
                                and
                                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
                                "Done".

                                projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                section,
                                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
                                contacts
                                can
                                be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.

                                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                individual
                                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card.
                                Fill in the
                                task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

                            <span>
                                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board
                                by
                                dragging
                                and dropping the card from one list to another.

                                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete
                                it.
                                Deleting a
                                card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when
                                deleting
                                cards,
                                as this action is irreversible.
